// Streaming session behavior of the restored WhisperKit transcriber, driven
// entirely through the ASR seams — `FakeSpeechEngine` (ModelLoading +
// SpeechDecoding) and `FakeAudioConverter` (AudioConverting). No real model, no
// WhisperKit SDK, no real CoreAudio, so accumulated sample counts are exact.
//
// Contract under test: the implementer builds the streaming `WhisperKitTranscriber`
// actor plus the `SpeechDecoding` and `AudioConverting` seams. RED mode now is a
// COMPILE failure — `WhisperKitTranscriber`, `SpeechDecoding`, `ModelLoading`,
// `AudioConverting`, and `WhisperKitBiasPromptBuilder` do not exist in the working
// tree yet.
//
// PINNED PRODUCTION SHAPE (lead-approved): the transcriber injects one engine
// playing BOTH ModelLoading + SpeechDecoding, a converter, and a clock, and builds
// its `ModelLifecycle` internally —
//   init(configuration: Configuration = .defaults,
//        engine: some ModelLoading & SpeechDecoding,
//        converter: some AudioConverting,
//        clock: some Clock)
// with `Configuration(keepWarmSeconds:)`. Keep-warm 0 makes didFinishUse release
// the model immediately, so release IS the observable proof of the lifecycle call.
//
// These tests pin TOKEN PLUMBING only, never bias EFFICACY (that stays L4 /
// on-device: `WhisperKitTranscriber.biasFieldVerification == .requiresL4Verification`).
